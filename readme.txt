The aim of this coursework is to implement and evaluate the minimax algorithm, with and without alpha-beta pruning. Full details are given in the coursework document, which you are expected to have read carefully.

Your implementation will be applied to a game called Connect, again described in the coursework document. Locations in the Connect board are indexed by the corresponding row, r, and column, c. Each coordinate (r,c) represents a space on the board, where a piece can be placed (noting that in play gravity determines in which row a piece is positoned). The goal is to have a given number of pieces arranged in a single, unbroken, line. This line can stretch across the board horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Players take it turns to select a column in which to place one of their pieces, and the piece will fall to the lowest numbered row that DOES NOT have a piece in it. For example, suppose that a player places their piece in column 4. If spaces (0,4) and (1,4) are already occupied, then the playerâ€™s piece will fall to position (2, 4).

Naturally, Connect has a large state space, and so an efficient minimax algorithm is important.

In this folder, you will find 5 Python files, which are described in the coursework document:

	player.py - This is the file in which you should implement your solution. There is a preamble which explains what you are expected to return from each method. Note that you must not change the method names or return types. You may not import additional modules.

	randomPlayer.py - This is a simple opponent to test against that always chooses a random move.

	game.py - This file creates a board, and cycles between the players, requesting their next move. This is the file that is used to actually perform the game.

	board.py - This file contains the class that represents the board, and the methods that are required to play a game of Connect. This file is also commented, as it can be used when implementing your minimax algorithm. It is suggested that you read the comments of this file thoroughly. 

	runGame.py - This is a simple script that will run a game. You can edit this file to create different scenarios to evaluate your solution.

The folder also contains a "report" subfolder, in which you will find the report template (report-template.tex) that you are required to use for your report. There is also a simple Python script that illustates how to generate plots to include in your report. Again, please see the coursework document for more details of the report.

When you have completed the coursework you should follow the submission instructions in the coursework document.
